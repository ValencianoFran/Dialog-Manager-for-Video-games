### Introduction 

Dialogues on videogames are very important, well-written dialogue is one of the most vital aspects in engaging a player with in-game characters. On this tutorial I'm going to talk about dialogues, their structure and how to structure the code to bring It to life :)

The difficulties in interactive conversation lie in giving the player the illusion of freedom while still feeling natural and driving the story forward along interesting paths. Finding the most interesting and engaging way for a player to interact with game characters and develop relationships potentially opens up a wide array of game concepts and themes not typically explored by classic game developers.

NPC interaction gameplay is a part of nearly every modern game and nowadays there are a lot of different Dialogue Systems. We can separate them into a few categories based on common design patterns:

## Non-Branching Dialogue

Is the simplest form of interaction, the NPC delivers his or her lines and the conversation ends wich means that the player have way to interact with them. It's the easiest dialogue to implement.

## Branching Dialogue

One common technique employed to give the player a greater illusion of freedom is to have multiple responses lead to the same path. The NPC talks and the player chooses his response between a limited set of choices. The player can not go back to previous text. Usually deppending on what the player answers, the NPC will change his next dialogue.
Conversation typically moves forward such that the player cannot go back to previous topics or responses. This one can have an infinity of variations. it's very common in most dating simulations and many western RPGs.

## Hub-and-Spokes Dialogue

A variation of the previous method, Hub-and-Spokes Dialogue creates a very different conversation flow compared to basic Branching Dialogue. The player listens to the NPC's lines and then chooses their response from the main "hub" of the conversation. The player can explore all the varieties and possibilities of the dialogues.
Some games like Mass Effect and Life is Strange uses this method.
